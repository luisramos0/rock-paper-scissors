How to build:
- install node, mocha, chai and sinon (with npm install), go to the base folder and type mocha to run the tests (should output: 29 passing)

How to run:
 - download, unzip and open index.html with Chrome

Comment:
- requirejs can be plugged in with minimal effort for better dependency injection and to remove all global scope polution (both code and test)
